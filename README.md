# UnityToolbag

This repo is a host for any little Unity scripts I write that are simple and easy for others to leverage. Each folder has its own README to explain the usage in more depth than here. All scripts are being written with the Unity 2019.4 LTS and may or may not work in earlier versions.## Usage

Simply clone the repository into the 'Assets' folder of a Unity project and you're good to go. If you're already using Git, you can use a submodule to check out into Assets without the Toolbag getting added to your repository.

Alternatively you can just cherry pick the features you want and copy only those folders into your project. Be careful, though, as some of the features may depend on others. See the individual feature README files to find out.

## Other Unity Repos

Here are some other repos that contain Unity goodies:

- [Open Character Controller](https://github.com/vdanish24/OpenCharacterController) - Framework for building first and third person character controllers in Unity.- [Awesome-Unity](https://github.com/RyanNielson/awesome-unity) - This is a neat repo that just lists a bunch of other Unity repos. Check there for great stuff.
